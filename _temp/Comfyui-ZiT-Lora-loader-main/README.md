Architecture-aware LoRA loader for **Z-Image Turbo** in ComfyUI.
![](images/node.png)

## Why not the default LoRA loader?

Z-Image Turbo uses a non-standard attention architecture that breaks ComfyUI's generic LoRA loader:

| Feature | Generic Loader | This Node |
|---|---|---|
| **Fused QKV attention** | Can't map separate `to_q`/`to_k`/`to_v` to fused `attention.qkv` -- silently drops keys | Auto-fuses Q/K/V into the correct `[11520, 3840]` tensor |
| **Output projection** | Expects `to_out.0`, Z-Image uses `attention.out` -- keys dropped | Remaps automatically |
| **Key mapping** | Generic heuristics | Uses `z_image_to_diffusers()` for exact Lumina2 architecture mapping |
| **Multi-format support** | Limited | Handles `diffusion_model.*`, `transformer.*`, `lycoris_*`, and bare prefixes |

The result: with the generic loader, most or all attention LoRA weights are silently dropped. This node ensures they actually get applied.

## Installation

Clone into your ComfyUI custom nodes directory:

```bash
cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes
git clone https://github.com/capitan01R/Comfyui-ZiT-Lora-loader.git
```

No additional dependencies required -- uses only ComfyUI builtins.

## Usage

The node appears under **loaders/Z-Image** as **Z-Image Turbo LoRA Loader**

### Inputs

| Input | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `model` | MODEL | Z-Image Turbo / Lumina2 model |
| `lora_name` | dropdown | LoRA file from your `models/loras` folder |
| `strength_model` | float | LoRA strength (-20.0 to 20.0, default 1.0) |
| `auto_convert_qkv` | boolean | Automatically fuse separate Q/K/V to Z-Image's fused QKV format (default: on) |

### When to enable auto_convert_qkv

- **ON** (default): If your LoRA was trained with a diffusers-style trainer that produces separate `to_q`/`to_k`/`to_v` weights
- **OFF**: If your LoRA was already trained against Z-Image Turbo's native fused QKV format
